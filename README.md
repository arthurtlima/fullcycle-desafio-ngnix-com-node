## 💻 About the project

<p>In this challenge, you will apply what we've learned about using nginx as a reverse proxy. The main idea is that when a user accesses nginx, it will make a request to our Node.js application. This application, in turn, will add a record to our MySQL database, registering a name in the 'people' table.</p>

### The Node.js application should return:

#### Full Cycle Rocks!

- List of names registered in the database.

<p>Generate the docker-compose file in a way that running 'docker-compose up -d' will make everything work and be available on port 8080.</p>
<p>The programming language for this challenge is Node/JavaScript.</p>
